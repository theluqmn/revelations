God gave me the opportunity to develop interests and gather various knowledge at a young age. My parents emphassized the importance of exposure, and I was fortunate enough to have a great environment to learn and grow. Both of them studied computer science, and dad is a tech entrepreneur - these factors helps in nurturing an interest in technology, startups, and business. I further developed my interests by working on projects, reading several books, and watching videos on YouTube related to the topics.

While it is true that information and knowledge are abundant and highly accessible, I have found out (the arduous way) that there are too many information out there to the point where it becomes overwhelming. A lot of us has ideas, but lacked the starting point. Most of the solutions out there are either paid, or cluttered with irrelevant ads and content (they had to make money somehow).

I started this newsletter on late January 2025 - the website design changed three times hahahaa, and hosted it on Github Pages ("theluqmn.github.io/revelations"). The agenda behind the creation of this newsletter is to share the knowledge, insights, and strategies that I have learnt throughout my life for othes to take benefit from - for free, out of good will. This project is also open source.

The Revelations is mainly targeted towards aspiring leaders, entrepreneurs, and curious individuals, but everyone is welcomed to have a look.

## Vision

### Exposure

The core vision of this newsletter is to expose the readers to countless topics that in my opinion, will aid in their quest to elevate their personal and professional lives. This includes an exceptional comprehension of STEM, finance, strategies, and more. With a larger exposure, readers will develop a better understanding of the world, and be able to make better decisions.

### Safe Haven

The Revelations is designed as a safe haven from the clutter of the internet. Free from ads, AI-generated content (unless mentioned otherwise, I do use AI to aid with autocomplete but only the ones I approve are added), cookies, and is 100% open source. It just works.

### Catalyst

Mosts people among us is struggling to grasp certain topics not due to their lack of intelligence, but rather due to the absence of a clear starting point. The articles on this newsletter are designed to solve this issue - using comprehensive and concise content as an overview, and a **Dive Deeper** section at the end, which includes countless resources that aims to guide you through a deeper understanding of the topic, in case readers are interested.

## Design

As previously mentioned, the design of this newsletter changed three times before I was satiesfied. In the world of fast-paced business, this would not happen but thank god it is a personal project - so I dictate the rules. I am actually a technical person (an Airbus A350 cockpit or a Bloomberg Terminal excites me), however, I went with a minimalist "it just works yet looks good" design by simply referring to a random invoice I found on Google (yes the design is based on an invoice), and slapped a dark seamless concrete background texture on it. I received positive feedback from several people, though some cricized it for being lacking technicality.
