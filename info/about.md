All thanks to god, I have been blessed with the opportunity to learn knowledge and skills from countless topics, spanning various fields - even at a young age. One day, I was discussing with a teacher on what and where should I specialise (I am a generalist), and he mentioned this rather interesting perspective - **"Success is when you apply what you have learned"**. He then mentions that god blesses those with knowledge, not those who are successful. With knowledge, you understand, and you will be able to act accordingly. That moment made me realise that I should take action and share my knowledge with others.

Hence, I started this newsletter on January 2025 and host it on GitHub Pages - "theluqmn.github.io/revelations". My goal, is to share the knowledge I have gathered throughout my life, share insights, strategies that I have learnt, and share my inspiration with the others. For free.

## The Vision

### Exposure

Another vision of this newsletter is to widen the readers' exposure on topics that in my opinion, are essential for the aspiring entrepreneurs, leaders, and curious individuals. The topics discussed are carefully curated, and covers finance, technology, strategy, inspiration, and more.

### Safe Haven

The Revelations is designed as a safe haven from the clutter of the internet. Free from ads, AI-generated content (unless mentioned otherwise), cookies, and is 100% open source.

### Catalyst

Mosts people among us is struggling to grasp certain topics not due to their lack of intelligence, but rather due to the absence of a clear starting point. The articles on this newsletter are designed to solve that - using comprehensive and concise content as an overview, and a **Dive Deeper** section at the end, which includes countless resources that aims to guide you through a deeper understanding of the topic.
