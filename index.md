## More about The Revelations

I started this initiative on January 2025 because in my opinion, knowledge is only valuable if applied and shared with others. Another reason is to increase the exposure of the readers - to expose them to new ideas, knowledge, perspectives, and skills. Once the users are exposed and interested, they will take the initiative to learn more about the topic and hopefully learn to apply the knowledge into their lives. My hope for this newsletter is to be a catalyst for this process.

For select articles, I would reach out to experts in the field to learn more about the topic, get their insights, and share it with the readers.

I am open to exploring new ideas and topics, hence if you have any suggestions or would like to share any helpful resources/materials, feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:luqman.yazrie@outlook.com) or [X/Twitter](https://x.com/theluqmn).
