Jamie Dimon (James Dimon) is the Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, which is the fifth largest bank in the world (over $3.9 trillion in assets). This firm also operates the largest investment bank in the world by revenue. A name formidable in the financial world, Dimon was born in 1956 in New York City of Greek ancestry. His father and grandfather were both stockbrokers at Shearson.

## How He Started

Jamie attended the Browning School and later majored in psychology and economics at Tufts University - where he wrote a paper on Shearson's mergers, which his mother sent to Sandy Weill. Sandy Weill became intrigued by the paper, and hired Dimon to work at Shearson during a summer break to do budgets. His relationship with Weill was a key factor in his career, which we will discuss later.

After graduating, Dimon worked in management consulting at the Boston Consulting Group for two years and later enrolled at the Harvard Business School. During the summer while he was at Harvard, he worked at Goldman Sachs. He graduated from Harvard in 1982, earning an MBA - as well as countless offers from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and other firms. Sandy Weill, knowing the potential of Dimon, convinced him to turn down the offers and instead join him as an assistant at American Express. Sandy Weill promised that he would have fun with him, although he could not offer the same amount of compensation as the investment banks. This marks the begging of Dimon's career in finance.
