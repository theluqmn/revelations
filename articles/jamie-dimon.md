Jamie Dimon (James Dimon) is the Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, which is the fifth largest bank in the world (over $3.9 trillion in assets). This firm also operates the largest investment bank in the world by revenue. A name formidable in the financial world, Dimon was born in 1956 in New York City of Greek ancestry. His father and grandfather were both stockbrokers at Shearson.

## How He Started

Jamie attended the Browning School and later majored in psychology and economics at Tufts University - where he wrote a paper on Shearson's mergers, which his mother sent to [Sandy Weill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanford_I._Weill). Sandy Weill became intrigued by the paper, and hired Dimon to work at Shearson during a summer break to do budgets. His relationship with Weill was a key factor in his career, which you will read more about later in the article.

After graduating, Dimon worked in management consulting at the Boston Consulting Group for two years and later enrolled at the Harvard Business School. During the summer while he was at Harvard, he worked at Goldman Sachs. He graduated from Harvard in 1982, earning an MBA - as well as countless offers from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and other firms. Sandy Weill, knowing the potential of Dimon, convinced him to turn down the offers and instead join him as an assistant at American Express. Sandy Weill promised that he would have fun with him, although he could not offer the same amount of compensation as the investment banks. This marks the beginning of Dimon's career in finance.

## His Career

We will now have an overview of Dimon's career in finance. This article will only highlight the key moments and events, however, if you are interested in learning more, the "Dive Deeper" section at the bottom of the article contains resources you can read and digest later. Now, let us begin.

### Commercial Credit (Primerica, Travelers Group)

As Sandy Weill left American Express in 1985, Dimon followed him. The two worked together and took over Commercial Credit (previously a subsidiary of Control Data Corporation), which is a consumer finance company. Weill and Dimon turned the company around, with Dimon appointed as CFO (chief financial officer) at age 30. In December 1998, Commercial Credit acquired Primerica Corporation and retains the Primerica name. Primerica began trading at the New York Stock Exchange in 6th February 1989.

Primerica then fully acquired the Travelers Insurance Corporation and adopted the name Travelers Inc (later Travelers Group) on 1993. Prior to the acquisition, Travelers acquired Shearson and Smith Barney (both were merged), and various other companies.

### Citigroup

Dimon and Weill formed the financial services conglomerate Citigroup in 1998 through a merger of Travelers Group and Citicorp. With this merger, Dimon, Weill, and [John (chairman of Citicorp)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_S._Reed) holds the highest positions of the firm. However, Dimon left the firm soon after the merger after Weill asked him to leave.

In an recent [interview with Dimon by David Novak (at the time of writing)](https://youtu.be/Xh6l39k3ngE?si=v2y3acq7mPIUAv-s), Dimon mentioned that he was given the title President which he did not ask for, and Weill told John that Dimon is pushing him. Dimon was supposed to run the global investment bank, but it changed to a tri-heads structure. Dimon expressed his frustrations with the change, and highlighted that the tri-heads and co-heads structure for every division will destroy the company. Later, Weill told Dimon that he and John wants him to resign, to which Dimon agreed.

### A Brief Break

After he left Citigroup, Dimon became somewhat clueless on what to do next, as quoted in the interview, ["I went from working 80 hours a week to zero, so I was like, what the hell am I gonna do"](https://youtu.be/Xh6l39k3ngE?si=Dx3T5W-VlyBbKzPH&t=2201). He made a list of the things he wanted to do, went to the bookstore and literally bought 30-40 books. He went to visit his brother in Denmark, drove cross country by himself, and even tried boxing. He also took his family on a long trip to Europe.
